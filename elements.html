         <h1><u>1. What is a Language?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.<b> Language </b> is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar and vocabulary. It is the primary means by which humans convey meaning, both in spoken and            signed forms, and may also be conveyed through writing.</p> <hr>

         <h1><u>2. What is a Programming language?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.1. A <b>programming language </b>is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a computer.<br>
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data analysis, and automation.<br>
3. <b>Examples:</b> C, Java, Python, JavaScript.</p><hr>

         <h1><u>3. Why Python?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS.1. <b>Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br>
2. <b>Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, functional).<br>
3.<b> Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.<br>
4. <b>Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.<br>
5. <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br>
6.<b> Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification (Windows, macOS, Linux).<br>
7.<b> Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g., Django)</p><hr>
   
         <h1><u>4. What is Python?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS 1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. a. Monty Python’s Flying Circus<br>
2. Older than Java (1995).</p><hr>
      
          <h1><u>5.Where Python is Used?</u></h1>
          <p>ANS 1. <b>Web Development:</b> Frameworks: Django, Flask.<br>
2. <b>Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.<br>
3.<b> Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks.<br>
4.<b> Game Development: </b>Framework: PyGame.<br>
5. <b>Scientific Computing: </b>Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.<br>
6.<b> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.<br>
7. <b>Web Scraping: </b>Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.<br>
8. <b>Cybersecurity:</b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.</p><hr>

2. Commands to check installations:<br>
a. In cmd: python --version</p><hr>

         <h1><u>8.Python Fundamentals:?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS1.<b>Variables</b><br>
a. A variable is a container. Called a variable because we can change the value of a variable.<br>
b. Snake Case for variables ( using _’s), Pascalcase for class names, All caps for constants<br>
c. There are no constants in python. You can only show your intention by writing All Capital letters.</p><hr>
         
         <h1><u>9.DataTypes?</u></h1>
         <p>ANS a.<b> Built In data types:</b><br>

ii. Sequence Type – string, list, tuple, Range<br>
1. There are no characters in Python. They are also strings<br>
iii. Mapping Type – dictionary (Key and Value pairs)<br>
iv. Set Type – Set<br>
v. None</p><hr>
